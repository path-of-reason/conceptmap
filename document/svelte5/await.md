{#await expression}...{:then name}...{:catch name}...{/await}

{#await expression}...{:then name}...{/await}

{#await expression then name}...{/await}

{#await expression catch name}...{/await}

Await blocks allow you to branch on the three possible states of a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) — pending, fulfilled or rejected.

{#await promise}
<!-- promise is pending -->
<p>waiting for the promise to resolve...</p>
{:then value}
<!-- promise was fulfilled or not a Promise -->
<p>The value is {value}</p>
{:catch error}
<!-- promise was rejected -->
<p>Something went wrong: {error.message}</p>
{/await}

> During server-side rendering, only the pending branch will be rendered.
>
> If the provided expression is not a `Promise`, only the `:then` branch will be rendered, including during server-side rendering.

The `catch` block can be omitted if you don’t need to render anything when the promise rejects (or no error is possible).

{#await promise}
<!-- promise is pending -->
<p>waiting for the promise to resolve...</p>
{:then value}
<!-- promise was fulfilled -->
<p>The value is {value}</p>
{/await}

If you don’t care about the pending state, you can also omit the initial block.

{#await promise then value}
<p>The value is {value}</p>
{/await}

Similarly, if you only want to show the error state, you can omit the `then` block.

{#await promise catch error}
<p>The error is {error}</p>
{/await}

> You can use `#await` with [`import(...)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) to render components lazily:
>
> {#await import('./Component.svelte') then { default: Component }}
> <Component />
> {/await}
